## Question 1

**Problem statement:** *Substring matching*

**Language**: *Java* 

**Description:**

+ Realtime DFA/Transition table formation.
+ Use Knuth-Morris-Pratt construction algorithm
+ Returns Found/ Not Found based on the criteria.
> Example implementation and pseudo code: http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~aus/cs1501/KMP_algorithm.pdf



## Question 3

**Problem statement:** *Vending machine implementation with Moore Machine*

**Language**: *python* 

**Description:**

+ The machine has 4 states namely, 
  + `0¢`
  + `5¢`
  + `10¢`
  + `15¢`
+ Input symbols are : `5`, `10`
+ Final State: `15¢`
+ Final Condition: Output string should contain at least one '1'.
+ Program exits after seeing '1' at the last position of output string.
